The above files build a mazeDFSGraph


This project will create a maze that
is constructed with a depth first
search graph. It fist creates the
graph and then goes through the graph
makes wall were needed so that a maze
is created.

To run this project you will need
to save the above files to the same
source code qfile before it can be tested.
After the correct environment is set up
a maze can be constructed. This is done
by going to RUN and then to EDIT CONFIG.
Once this is open you can enter the width
and height of a desired maze as well as
what you would like the file to be called
(ex: 6 6 maze.txt). A file has been made
that will have a random maze that has been
created. You can now drag and drop this file
in a maze builder and there is the maze.
