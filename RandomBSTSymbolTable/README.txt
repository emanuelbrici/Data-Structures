Files:
RandomBSTSymoblTable.java
Node.java
README.txt

The above files build a BSTSymbolTable.

This project has three main components to it.
It has an insert method that will insert Node
with certain keys and values following the
rules of a BST. It also contains a search
method which can find any node with a key in
it and if not it will let you know that the key
is not found. Remove is the third main method
that is has that removes any node in the tree
that is asked to be removed.

To run my code make sure that the above files are
all located in the same java project. The node is
constructed in its own class so this one must not
be forgotten. To run the code you need to save the
files and then run it through your IDE. Once it has
completed compiling you need to open the terminal and
find the directory that it is located. Once your there
you type "open tree!.svg" and the tree should open
up in an internet browser. At this point you can see
the tree and how it was constructed.
