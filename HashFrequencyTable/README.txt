The above files build and test a HashFrequencyTable.

This project has two main components that will build
and count the entries of a HashFrequencyTable. The way
that the HashFrequencyTable is put together is with the
method click. Click goes through the table after it has
the hashcode and places the entry in the right location.
Count is used to find a specific entry and then return
the count of that entry.

To run my code make sure that the above files are
all located in the same java project. To run the
HashFrequencyTable you need to save the files and
then run it through your IDE. A dump is used to empty
all the contents into the console after the program is
finished running. To run SortedWordCount.java with the
mobydick-words.txt you are going to need to go to run
and open up edit configurations. Then in program
arguments you are going to want to insert
mobydick-words.txt 10. The 10 means that SortWordCounter.java
is going to return the top 10 counted words in the
txt file.
